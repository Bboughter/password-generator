# password-generator

## Description

This project's assignment was to create a random password generator in order for an employee to access sensitive data. It was required to meet certain criterias so a strong password would be created for greater security. Some of the criteria included the password being between 8 and 128 characters and at least one of the following must be selected: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. The user was pronmpted to provide how many characters they wanted for their password as well as being prompted to indicate whether or not they wanted to include lowercase, uppercase, special characters, or numbers. There were prompts in place to tell the user that they had chose not to include the selected character type in their password. There was also a prompt in place to tell the user if criteria was not being met.

The amount of characters must be between 8 and 128. There will next be a prompt asking you if you would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers. If you click cancel on either of the character types, you will be prompted with a box that will tell you that character will not be included. At least one of the character types must be selected.
